This folder contains preprocessing scripts for BVP and EDA data collected with Empatica wristbands, E4 and Embrace Plus. 

It is necessary to install all packages listed in "requirements.txt" to use this preprocessing pipeline. 

The only file that has to be adjusted is "run-preproPSYPHY.py". This file then loads the relevant functions from the other files. 

The tag files have to be created manually and contain information for the script on which files to process and how to cut them. The possible settings are explained in the example files.
