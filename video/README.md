# BOKI: videos

This folder contains the synchrony computations based on preprocessing of the face and scene videos with OpenFace and MEA, respectively. OpenFace creates csv files with the activation in facial action units per frame, while MEA creates txt files that contain frame-by-frame changes capturing motion quantity. 

The scripts compute interpersonal synchrony based on facial action units and motion quantity as well as intrapersonal synchrony of motion quantity based on MEA and head movements extracted by OpenFace.
